The database_connection.rb script in the initializers folder depends on a db_config.yml file in this folder for database credentials. Format should be like:

acumen:
  user: a user with write access
  password: hopefully something secure
  dbname: postgres
  port: 5432
  host: The "Public DNS" of the EC2 instance running the database
